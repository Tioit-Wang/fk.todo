## What is MustDo?

MustDo is a desktop-first todo app built for one thing: getting tasks done, not managing tasks.

- Quick capture: add a task in seconds, stay in flow
- Always in sight: a desktop-friendly layout that keeps today visible
- When it matters: “forced reminders” for tasks you cannot ignore
- Simple, calm, and fast: minimal friction from idea to action

Screenshots below use the light theme.

## Why we built it

Most todo apps are great at storing tasks—less great at making you act.
MustDo is designed for desktop life: quick entry, persistent visibility, and reminders that actually cut through the noise when you need them.

## Tech (lightweight on purpose)

Built with Tauri v2 (Rust) + React + TypeScript (Vite) to stay lightweight, responsive, and cross-platform.
